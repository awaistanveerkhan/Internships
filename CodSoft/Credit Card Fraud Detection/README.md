# Task-02 CodSoft Internship : Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Problem Statement: 
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. So,this system is used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. Our aim here is to detect 100% of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.

## Dataset:
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, the original features and more background information about the data are not available. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

## Approach:

### Isolation Forest
Isolation Forest is an ensemble-based algorithm that isolates anomalies by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature. Anomalies are expected to require fewer splits to be isolated, making them stand out as shorter paths in the tree.

### Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
LOF quantifies the local density deviation of a data point with respect to its neighbors. Anomalies will have significantly lower density than their neighbors. LOF calculates a score that reflects the degree of anomaly, allowing for ranking of instances based on their degree of being an outlier.

## Results
- Isolation Forest detected 73 errors versus Local Outlier Factor detecting 97 errors vs. SVM detecting 8516 errors
- Isolation Forest has a 99.74% more accurate than LOF of 99.65% and SVM of 70.09
- When comparing error precision & recall for 3 models , the Isolation Forest performed much better than the LOF as we can see that the detection of fraud cases is around 27 % versus LOF detection rate of just 2 % and SVM of 0%.
- So overall Isolation Forest Method performed much better in determining the fraud cases which is around 30%.
- We can also improve on this accuracy by increasing the sample size or use deep learning algorithms however at the cost of computational expense.We can also use complex anomaly detection models to get better accuracy in determining more fraudulent cases
