# Task-01 CodSoft Internship : Titanic Survival Prediction

## Question: 
Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The [dataset](https://lnkd.in/dZqW8GaY) contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket, class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

Here's a quick review of what's in notebook:<br>
- Imported essential libraries like sklearn, pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib.<br>
- Used `Stratified Sampling` to split the data equally for classes of `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Embarked`.<br>
- Used `Pipelineing` for `preprocessing` the data by handling missing values. <br>
- Finally applied `RandomForestClassifier` for prediction.
