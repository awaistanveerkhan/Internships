# CodSoft Data Science Internship Program

## Task1 - Titanic Survival Prediction
Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The [dataset](https://lnkd.in/dZqW8GaY) contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket, class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

## Task2 - Credit Card Fraud Detection
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

## Task3 - Movie Rating Prediction
A model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like `genre`, `movie name`,`user ratings` and alot more. The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.
