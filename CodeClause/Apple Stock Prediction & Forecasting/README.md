# Apple Stock Prediction & Forecasting
This Deep Learning project on Apple Stock Prediction & Forecasting is a part of remote internship as a Data Scientist at CodeClause.

## Project Information
I implemented a `Stacked LSTM` architecture, a powerful variant of `recurrent neural networks` (RNNs), to capture the temporal dependencies in the stock data. By stacking `multiple LSTM layers`, I aimed to enhance the model's ability to learn complex patterns and make accurate predictions. The model trained at an incredibly lower loss and validation loss. During the project, I focused on utilizing the `closing stock` prices of Apple on a daily basis, and later `forecasted` the next `30 days` closing stock prices of Apple.
